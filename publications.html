        <b>Abstract:</b> 
        The temporal evolution of entanglement between a noisy system and an ancillary system is analyzed in the context of continuous time open quantum system dynamics. Focusing on a couple of analytically solvable models for qubit systems, we study how Markovian and non-Markovian characteristics influence the problem, discussing in particular their associated entanglement-breaking regimes. These performances are compared with those one could achieve when the environment of the system is forced to return to its input configuration via periodic instantaneous resetting procedures.

        <b>Abstract:</b> 
        An ensemble Green's function formalism, based on the von Neumann density matrix approach, to calculate one-electron excitation spectra of a many-electron system with degenerate ground states is proposed. A set of iterative equations for the ensemble Green's function and self-energy is derived and a simplest approximation corresponding to an ensemble $GW$ approximation is naturally obtained. The derivation is based on the Schwinger functional derivative technique and does not assume any adiabatic connection between a noninteracting and an interacting ground state.

        <b>Abstract:</b> 
        The electrostatics arising in ferroelectric/dielectric two-dimensional heterostructures and superlatitices is revisited here within a simplest Kittel model, in order to define a clear paradigmatic reference for domain formation. The screening of the depolarizing field in isolated ferroelectric or polar thin films via the formation of 180$^{\circ}$ domains is well understood, whereby the width of the domains $w$ grows as the square-root of the film thickness $d$, following Kittel's law, for thick enough films ($w\ll d$). This behavior is qualitatively unaltered when the film is deposited on a dielectric substrate, sandwiched between dielectrics, and even in a superlattice setting, with just a suitable renormalisation of Kittel's length. As $d$ decreases, $w(d)$ deviates from Kittel's law, reaching a minimum and then diverging onto the mono-domain limit for thin enough films, always assuming a given spontaneous polarization $P$ of the ferrolectric, only modified by linear response to the depolarizing field. In most cases of experimental relevance $P$ would vanish before reaching that thin-film regime. This is not the case for superlattices. Unlike single films, for which the increase of the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium pushes the deviation from the Kittel's regime to lower values of $d$, there is a critical value of the relative thickness of ferroelectric/dielectric films in superlattices beyond which that behavior is reversed, and which defines the separation between strong and weak ferroelectric coupling in superlattices.

        <b>Abstract:</b> 
        In core-collapse supernovae or compact binary merger remnants, neutrino-neutrino refraction can spawn fast pair conversion of the type $ν_e \barν_e \leftrightarrow ν_x \barν_x$ (with $x=μ, τ$), governed by the angle-dependent density matrices of flavor lepton number. All angle modes evolve coherently for a homogeneous and axially symmetric two-flavor system, and the nonlinear equations of motion are equivalent to those of a gyroscopic pendulum. Our main innovation is to identify the real part of the eigenfrequency resulting from the linear normal-mode analysis of the neutrino system as the "pendulum spin." This is the elusive characteristic of the lepton-number angle distribution that determines the depth of conversion, without solving the nonlinear evolution equations.

        <b>Abstract:</b> 
        The connection between Feynman integrals and GKZ $A$-hypergeometric systems has been a topic of recent interest with advances in mathematical techniques and computational tools opening new possibilities; in this paper we continue to explore this connection. To each such hypergeometric system there is an associated toric ideal, we prove that the latter has the Cohen-Macaulay property for two large families of Feynman integrals. This implies, for example, that both the number of independent solutions and dynamical singularities are independent of space-time dimension and generalized propagator powers. Furthermore, in particular, it means that the process of finding a series representation of these integrals is fully algorithmic.
