        <b>Abstract:</b> 
        In core-collapse supernovae or compact binary merger remnants, neutrino-neutrino refraction can spawn fast pair conversion of the type $ν_e \barν_e \leftrightarrow ν_x \barν_x$ (with $x=μ, τ$), governed by the angle-dependent density matrices of flavor lepton number. All angle modes evolve coherently for a homogeneous and axially symmetric two-flavor system, and the nonlinear equations of motion are equivalent to those of a gyroscopic pendulum. Our main innovation is to identify the real part of the eigenfrequency resulting from the linear normal-mode analysis of the neutrino system as the "pendulum spin." This is the elusive characteristic of the lepton-number angle distribution that determines the depth of conversion, without solving the nonlinear evolution equations.

        <b>Abstract:</b> 
        The connection between Feynman integrals and GKZ $A$-hypergeometric systems has been a topic of recent interest with advances in mathematical techniques and computational tools opening new possibilities; in this paper we continue to explore this connection. To each such hypergeometric system there is an associated toric ideal, we prove that the latter has the Cohen-Macaulay property for two large families of Feynman integrals. This implies, for example, that both the number of independent solutions and dynamical singularities are independent of space-time dimension and generalized propagator powers. Furthermore, in particular, it means that the process of finding a series representation of these integrals is fully algorithmic.
